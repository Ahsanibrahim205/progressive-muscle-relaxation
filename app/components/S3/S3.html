                            <li>The ability to become physically relaxed, to do so regularly and at times of most
                                need is as crucial for promoting good health as regular bouts of aerobic physical
                                exercise. </li>
                            <li>It has been demonstrated that many illnesses, which affect the body and the
                                mind in today’s world, are connected to sustained and high levels of physical
                                tension. </li>
                            <li>Physical tension in response to pressure and stress can become a habit and then
                                go unnoticed. </li>
                            <li>Research evidence suggests that to change a behaviour it needs to be practised
                                for a minimum of 21 days, habitual practice of becoming physically relaxed is
                                recommended, preferably on a daily basis. </li>
                            <li>Starting with a period of ‘non-activity’ and allow 15 to 30 minutes for practice until
                                you become familiar with the activity</li>
                            <li>Practice of progressive muscular relaxation over a period of time will make it a
                                well-rehearsed skill, which is enjoyable and can be done in 15 minutes or less. </li>
                            <li>The time taken can be reduced and some muscular relaxation will still be
                                produced, particularly if it is directed at localised acute tension areas. However,
                                for full physical and mental relaxation benefits time pressure (that may have
                                produced the tension in the first place) is best avoided. Treat it as a great timeout and, above all, enjoy it. </li>
